# Description
This project uses system calls (read, write, open and close) instead of library functions like printf, scanf, fopen, fclose, fscanf and fprintf. I did not use any string.h function. 
Instead, I implemented my own function when deadling with string. 

# Execution
- On terminal(Compilation): make 
- On terminal (Executing): ./prime numbers.txt
- On terminal (Cleaning - removing executable files): make clean
  
There's a makefile in the repository which deals with all the linking and compilation. By just running make in the console, handles compilation.
